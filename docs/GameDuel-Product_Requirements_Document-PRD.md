- Pagination for large datasets
- Metadata updates propagate correctly
- Orphaned data cleaned up periodically

**Technical Notes**:
- Consider using SQLite for complex queries (expo-sqlite)
- Or use AsyncStorage with indexed structure
- Implement cleanup routines

---

#### Story 5.4: Gaming Data Sync
**As a** developer  
**I want** to sync gaming data efficiently  
**So that** users see up-to-date information

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Gaming data syncs on connection
- Background sync every 24 hours
- Manual refresh option available
- Sync respects API rate limits
- Failed syncs retry with exponential backoff

**Technical Notes**:
- Implement background fetch (expo-background-fetch)
- Queue API requests to manage rate limits
- Store last sync timestamp

---

#### Story 5.5: App Configuration
**As a** developer  
**I want** centralized app configuration  
**So that** settings are consistent and manageable

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Environment variables for API keys
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Remote config for dynamic updates (future)
- Dev/staging/production environments

**Technical Notes**:
- Use expo-constants for config
- Environment-specific .env files
- Never commit sensitive keys

### 5.4 API Integration Specifications

#### Steam Web API
- **Base URL**: `https://api.steampowered.com`
- **Auth**: API Key + OAuth 2.0
- **Key Endpoints**:
  - `ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v2` - User profile
  - `IPlayerService/GetOwnedGames/v1` - Game library
  - `ISteamUserStats/GetPlayerAchievements/v1` - Achievements
- **Rate Limit**: 100,000 calls/day

#### Xbox Live API
- **Base URL**: `https://xapi.us` (or official Microsoft endpoint)
- **Auth**: Microsoft OAuth 2.0
- **Key Endpoints**:
  - `/v2/{xuid}/profile` - Profile data
  - `/v2/{xuid}/achievements` - Achievements
  - `/v2/{xuid}/game-history` - Recent games
- **Rate Limit**: Check Xbox Live policies

#### PlayStation Network API
- **Note**: PSN does not have official public API
- **Options**:
  - Use unofficial wrapper libraries (check legal/ToS)
  - Or implement Sony OAuth if official access granted
- **Data**: Trophy information, game library

### 5.5 Security Considerations

1. **OAuth Implementation**:
   - Use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for mobile OAuth flows
   - Validate redirect URIs strictly
   - Store tokens in secure storage only

2. **API Keys**:
   - Never hardcode API keys
   - Use environment variables via Expo's secure config
   - Rotate keys periodically

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use HTTPS for all API calls
   - Implement certificate pinning (future)

4. **User Privacy**:
   - Request minimum necessary permissions
   - Provide clear privacy policy
   - Allow users to disconnect gaming accounts
   - Local data deletion on account removal

## 7. Risks & Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Gaming API access denied | High | Medium | Investigate official partnerships, use documented APIs only |
| Gaming API rate limits | Medium | High | Implement aggressive caching, background sync, request queuing |
| Video recording fails on some devices | High | Medium | Test on wide range of devices, implement fallbacks |
| Storage constraints on devices | Medium | Medium | Implement storage management, warn users, offer cloud storage (future) |
| OAuth flow complexity | Medium | Medium | Use well-tested libraries, implement comprehensive error handling |
| Performance issues with large video libraries | Medium | Low | Implement pagination, lazy loading, periodic cleanup |
| User privacy concerns with gaming data | Medium | Low | Clear privacy policy, user control over data, minimal data collection |
| App rejection from app stores | High | Low | Follow all guidelines, test thoroughly, prepare appeals |

---

## 8. Assumptions

1. **Gaming Platform Access**: We assume Steam, Xbox, and PSN will allow OAuth integration for gaming data. If official APIs are not available, we'll use documented third-party wrappers or limit functionality.

2. **User Connectivity**: We assume users have internet connectivity for OAuth flows and gaming data sync. Offline mode will have limited functionality.

3. **Device Capabilities**: We assume target devices have:
   - Front and back cameras
   - Minimum 2GB RAM
   - At least 1GB free storage
   - iOS 13+ or Android 8+

4. **User Behavior**: We assume users are familiar with:
   - Basic mobile app navigation
   - Gaming platform accounts (Steam/Xbox/PSN)
   - Video recording on mobile

5. **Legal/Compliance**: We assume:
   - Gaming platform ToS allow this use case
   - Data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) are complied with
   - Content created by users is their responsibility

## 9. Constraints

1. **Technical**:
   - 15-second video limit (intentional constraint)
   - Local storage only for MVP (no cloud storage)
   - React Native/Expo framework limitations
   - Gaming API rate limits and data access restrictions

2. **Timeline**:
   - MVP target: 16-18 weeks
   - Limited development resources
   - Dependency on external API availability

3. **Budget**:
